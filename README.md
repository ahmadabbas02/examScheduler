# examScheduler

examScheduler is a python script made to output the exam dates from Eastern Meditterenan University's website to a schedule.txt with table format and sorted according to date. It was created because there was always a delay for the exam schedule to become visible in the student portal.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements.txt.

```bash
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Enter your course codes as list in the variable `courses_list`.

2. Run the script

   ```bash
   python .\main.py
   ```

3. Open schedule.txt to see your exam schedule.
